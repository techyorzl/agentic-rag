      "PURPOSE:To obtain a secondary battery having an excellent charge/discharge cycle life and a high capacity by using a material obtained by mixing a prescribed mix volume of acetonitrile with one kind among ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate or butylene carbonate as nonaqueous solvent. CONSTITUTION:A carbonaceous material of a negative electrode 3 in a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery is made to bear Li thereon, and a chalcogen compound such as Mn oxide is contained in a positive electrode 1 as an active material, and hexafluoride lithium phosphate is used as nonaqueous electrolyte after about 0.5-1.5 mole/l of it is dissolved into nonaqueous solution as electrolyte. The nonaqeous solution is formed by mixing acetonitrile of about 10-60volume% with one kind among ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate and butylene carbonate. At this time, diameter of an Li ion solvation complex in the nonaqueous electrolyte can be reduced. Thereby, the complex can infiltrate easily between layers of a carbonic material of the negative electrode 3 so that storage/emission volume of Li ion can be increased at the negative electrode. Moreover, since there is no reactivity between the nonaqueous solution and the carbonic material, a structure of the carbonic material can be kept in an excellent condition so that the secondary battery having high capacity can be made.\n",
