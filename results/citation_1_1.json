  "abstract": "The invention provides a control method of a power grid-friendly distributed power supply based on hybrid energy storage, comprising the following steps: optimizing the topology structure of the distributed power supply; and coordinatingly controlling the DC power supply system through the DC/DC converter control mode normalization model ; Grid adaptive control of DC/AC converter on the AC side. The distributed power supply can be integrated into the large power grid to reduce the impact of intermittent renewable energy generation on the grid, and provide voltage and frequency support for the grid; it can also be integrated into the micro grid as a network of off-grid micro grids The unit operates to maintain the voltage and frequency stability of the off-grid microgrid; when the external grid fails, the distributed power supply can also realize the dual-mode switching of grid-connected/isolated, improving the reliability of power supply for important loads in the system. The distributed power supply is used in conjunction with energy-type and power-type energy storage systems, which improves the technical performance and economic performance of the entire system.",
